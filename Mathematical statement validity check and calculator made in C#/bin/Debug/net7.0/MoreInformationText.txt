This program is deisnged to accept a valid input of a non-variable mathematical expression, and then manipulate it until it is in a calculable form.
The final calculated result will then be displayed to the user.

~

This calculator cannot solve equations, and it will not accept variables as input.
This calculator only accepts numbers, both whole and non-whole (i.e. 3 , 5.35), and the basic mathematical operators.
Said basic mathematical operators are the following: +  -  *  /  ^

~

The basic operators are defined as follows:
+ : This is the addition operator, and it is used to find the sum of two numbers.
- : This is the subtraction operator, and it is used to find the difference of two numbers.
/ : This is the division operator, and it is used to find the quotient of two numbers.
* : This is the multiplication operator, and it is used to find the product of two numbers.
^ : This is the exponential operator, and it is used to exponentiate one number with respect to another.

Examples:
+ :  3 + 4 = 7
- :  3 - 9 = -6
/ :  1 / 4 = 0.25
* :  3 * 7 = 21
^ :  3 ^ 3 = 27

This calculator follows the standard rules of the order of operations, whose acronym is represented by PEMDAS.
PEMDAS stands for: Parenthesis - Exponents - Multiplication - Division - Addition - Subtraction
Where both Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction have interchangability.

Below are examples of acceptable inputs, with their associated outputs:
Input: 3+5                        Output: 8
Input: 3(5+1)                     Output: 18
Input: 5+3*6/2                    Output: 14
Input: 3((5*6)+3+(4*1))+2         Output: 113
Input: -(-(4+(9-3^-(1+2))))-7     Output: 5.962962962962964

Acceptable mutliplication format:
Note that multiplication can occur with numbers adjacent to closing parenthesis, like this: (2+3)4

Below are examples of unacceptable inputs, with their associated erroneous outputs:
Input: 3++5           Output: Incorrect due to operator conflict. Improper usage of addition operator. 
Input: 3(5+1          Output: Incorrect due to improper usage of parentheses. There is no closing parenthesis.
Input: -/3+(3-8)      Output: Incorrect due to operator conflict. No number is defined on the left side of division operator.
Input: 3+(5)+()       Output: Incorrect due to improper usage of parentheses. Parentheses cannot be empty.
Input: x+4-9^7        Output: Incorrect due to invalid character. The character x is not a valid character for this calculator.
Input: 3-2(+3)/(5+5)  Output: Incorrect due to operator conflict. There is no number on the left side of the first addition operator.
